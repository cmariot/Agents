# Unit 1 : Introduction to agents

## What is an agent?

An agent is an AI model capable of reasoning, planning, and interacting with its environment.

An Agent is a system that uses an AI Model (typically a LLM) as its core reasoning engine, to:

- Understand natural language: Interpret and respond to human instructions in a meaningful way.
- Reason and plan: Analyze information, make decisions, and devise strategies to solve problems.
- Interact with its environment: Gather information, take actions, and observe the results of those actions.

An AI agent is a system that perceives its environment, processes information, and takes actions to achieve a goal.


## Agent planning and reasoning

In artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomous systems, planning is a crucial function that enables an agent to decide on a sequence of actions to achieve its goal efficiently. It allows the agent to think ahead rather than simply reacting to immediate inputs.

Agents can decide on the sequence of actions and select the best tools to achieve their goals. They can also adapt their strategies based on the results of their actions and the feedback they receive from the environment.

## Tools are agents capabilities

In AI tools play a crucial role in enhancing an agent’s capabilities by improving its ability to perceive, reason, plan, and act effectively. These tools provide external resources, computational power, and real-world connectivity that extend what an agent can achieve.

Tools can help an agent in several ways:
- Expanding Knowledge → Access to external data sources (APIs, databases, or web search).
- Improving Decision-Making → Using algorithms, planners, or machine learning models.
- Enhancing Efficiency → Automating tasks that would otherwise take too much time.
- Enabling Execution → Allowing the agent to interact with external systems (robotics, blockchain, web applications).
